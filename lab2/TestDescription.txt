Two testing files, "psout.txt" and "lab2out.txt" were made to show the output of the ps command from the kernel and the output
of our kernel module respectively. Apart from some spacing difference, it can be seen that the output from the kernel and our
module are exactly the same except for the last line. This can be attributed to the fact that what is being output is the
information of processes. Since we are inputing commands, this sends new tasks to the processor which creates a new task, as
such, since the last process is the one we just inputed and it gets completed immediately, the information regarding the last
process shown between the two test files is different.

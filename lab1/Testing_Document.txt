From the script document "test1.txt" which shows the input and output of the shell program, the commands pwd, cd, and ls were   shown to be working as intended.
The pwd command shows that the current directory is "/home/student/ELEC377-Group-35/lab1". After entering the cd command with no
second argument changes the directory to the home directory, this is shown by using the pwd command once again which outputs
"/home/student". When entering the ls command, the contents of the directory is listed and we can see that there is only the
"ELEC377-Group-35" directory. After entering the cd command again with the second argument "ELEC377-Group-35", we change our 
directory to "/home/student/ELEC377-Group-35" as shown by ls listing new contents of the directory and the pwd command. The ls
command is entered again with the second argument "-a" to show hidden files as well. This also works because more contents are
listed, specifically the contents that start with ".". Next, the commands ls and cd are entered with second arguments that
are invalid and it can be seen that an error is outputed since they are invalid. Finally, the exit command is entered and the
program is terminated as we return to the linux shell.
A second script documrnt "shelltest.txt" shows the same commands in the same order producing the same results.

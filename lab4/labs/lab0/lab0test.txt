 Name: lab0mod.c  ELEC 377 Demo Module

 Pupose:
	Demo Lab showing the use of Linux Modules
	Return How long OS has been running in a human readable string
	through a /proc file

	Author: Thomas R. Dean


 Function: my_read:
   A function that will be called by the kernel when
   the user reads the /proc file. In this case, the number
   of characters is always less than the size of the buffer,
   so we use a simplified version of the /proc api. We write
   the time of boot as a unix time stamp into the buffer.

   Parameters:
       page  the buffer provided by the kernel
	 start  point to pointer to indicate which buffer was  used
	 fpos  the postion in the file
	 blen  the length of page (ignored)
	 eof   pointer to indicate end of file
	 data  module private data pointer (ignored)

   Return value:
	int  The number of bytes written into the buffer


 Name: init_module

 Purpse: Called by the kernel to initialize
	any data structures used by the module when
	the module is loaded. In this case we will
	add our file entry to the /proc file system

 Paramters:
	None

 Return value:
     int 0 on success, nonzero for failure


 Name: cleanup_module

 Purpose: Called by the kernel to deallocate
	any data structures used by the module when
	the module is removed from the kernel. In our
      case we remove the entry from the /proc file system

 Paramters:
	None

  Returns:
	None

	lab0user.c  ELEC377 Demo User Module

	This program reads the results produced by our /proc module
	and formats it for the user.

	Author: Thomas R. Dean


 Funtion main
 
 Purpose: This function reads the file /proc/Lab0
   The contents of the file is the unix time stamp giving the
   time when the system was booted. It uses the ctime library
   to convert the string to a readable form and prints an
   appropriate message.

 Parameters:
	none

 Returns int

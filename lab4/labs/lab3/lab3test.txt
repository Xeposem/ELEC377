 Name: common.c

 Purpose: contains routines to be used by both the producer,
       and the consumer. 
       Mutual Exclusion routines are here.


 Function: test_and_set

  Purpose: C wrapper for the xmpxchng machine languate instruction.
   Reads the value of the lock variable and sets it to 1.

  Paramters:
	lock  the address of the shared lock variable

  Returns
	The value of lock variable from the exchange.


  getMutex  The C implemenation of the spinlock test
   and set approach. This function busy waits until the
   lock is false and then sets it to true.

  Paramters:
	lock  the address of the shared lock variable

  Returns
	Nothing


  releaseMutex  The C implemenation of the spinlock test
   and set approach. This sets the lock to false.

  Paramters:
	lock  the address of the shared lock variable

  Returns
	Nothing

 Name: shared

 Purpose: 
   Defines the variables in the shared memory segment

 Fields:
    lock  the shared lock varible
    buffer  the array used for the fifo queue
    inPtr  the array index at which elements are inserted.
    outPtr  the array index at which elements are removed.
    count  the number of elements in the queue
    prodCount  the number of running producers.

 Name:  consumer.c

 Purpose: this file implements the consumer using a
   shared segement and a simple implementatin of mutual exclusion.


 Name:  main

 Purpose: This is the main function. It implements the conumer using a
   shared segement and a simple implementatin of mutual exclusion.

 Parameters:
	argc  count of command line arguments (ignored)
	argv  array of command line arguments (ignored)

 Parameters:
      int

 Name:  meminit.c

 Purpose: This file creates and initializes a shared memory segment.


 Name:  main

 Purpose: This is the main function. It creates a shared memory
   segment if it does not alreay exist. The id of the shared
   memory segement is attached to the current directory. After
   creration, it is mapped and initialized to Zero.

 Parameters:
	argc  count of command line arguments (ignored)
	argv  array of command line arguments (ignored)

 Parameters:
      int

============================================


 Name:  producer.c

 Purpose: this file implements the producer using a
   shared segement and a simple implementatin of mutual exclusion.


 Name:  main

 Purpose: This is the main function. It implements the producer using a
   shared segement and a simple implementatin of mutual exclusion.

 Parameters:
	argc  count of command line arguments (ignored)
	argv  array of command line arguments (ignored)

 Parameters:
      int

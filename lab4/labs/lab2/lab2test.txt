============================================


 Module:  lab2.c

 Purpose: This file provides a kernel module that 
     prints the list of active processes giving
     the process id, the userid, the total number
     of VM pages and the number of VM pages that are resident.



 Name: my_read_proc:

  Purpose:
   this function that will be called by the kernel when
   the user reads the /proc/lab2 file. The first time the proc
   is read (fpos is 0) we return the headers and the data for
   the first process. On subsequent calls we return the data
   for the next process. We return EOF when we have reached
   the first proc.

   Parameters:
       page  the buffer provided by the kernel
	 start  point to pointer to indicate which buffer was  used
	 fpos  the postion in the file
	 blen  the length of page (ignored)
	 eof   pointer to indicate end of file
	 data  module private data pointer (ignored)

   Return value:
	int  The number of bytes written into the buffer


 Name: init_module

  Purpose:
	Called by the kernel to initialize
      any data structures used by the module when
      the module is loaded. In this case we will
      add our file entry to the /proc file system

  Parameters:
	None

 Return value
      int  0 on success, non-zero for failure


 Name: cleanup_module

 Purpose:
	 Called by the kernel to deallocate
      any data structures used by the module when
      the module is removed from the kernel. In our
      case we remove the entry from the /proc file system

  Parameters:
	None

 Return value
      none

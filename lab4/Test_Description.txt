To test the validity of the script files, test files were made. To test the first script file "printDoc.sh", a test file was 
made for each directory in the "labs" directory. As such, four test files were made: lab0test.txt, lab1test.txt, lab2test.txt, 
and lab3test.txt. These test files were made by piping the output of printDoc.sh to the test files for each of the respective 
directories. Looking at lab0test.txt first, the two files "lab0mod.c" and "lab0user.c" were found. The correct comments were 
also extracted from the files. Only the comments that were in the blocks starting with "//+" and ending with "//-" were 
extracted, normal comments were not. Also, all the "//+", "//-", and "//" at the start of the lines were removed as intended. 
This result is the same when comparing the rest of the testing results.
To test the second script file "progStats.sh", a single test file was created named "progStatsTest.txt" using the script 
command. From the test file, we see that the correct main files and module files are found. The count for printf is also 
correctly not double counting "fprintf". This can be confirmed by looking at the result from the test file and manually 
counting the number of printf and fprintf statements in the file. The line numbers listed for the printk statements that appear 
in the module files are also found correctly.

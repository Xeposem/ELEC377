To test the validity of the program, two test files, test00in.txt and test01in.txt, were made as inputs to test the program. 
They each contained lines of text that were different to each other. Then, two producer processes were run at the same time 
using the two test files as inputs and the output of the consumer process was streamed into the test file test02out.txt. 
From test02out.txt, it can be seen that each byte was transferred a single time in the proper order from producer to consumer, 
and that all the lines of test00in.txt were printed before the lines from test01in.txt were printed.

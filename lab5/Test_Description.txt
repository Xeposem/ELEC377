To test the validity of the attack, two test files were created, "selfcompOutput.txt" and "clientOutput.txt".
The first test was on selfcomp.c. After adding the right amount of X's, in the string array, the correct length was
determined to allow for the alignment of the return address. The debugger was then used to find the address of the .bss,
and then we found where the start of the buffer was in that .bss by taking the starting address of the bss, using the command
x/16c address to see the contents at that address, and incremendting the address by 0x10 until the X's started showing up,
representing the start of the buffer. This resulted in a successful attack as seen from the testing file "selfcompOutput.txt".
"selfcompOutput.txt" contains a list of information from the passwd file that originally is not accessable.

The second test was on the server. After adjusting the code to work with the server, the output was pipped to the testing file
"clientOutput.txt". When comparing the two test files, they are exactly the same which shows that the attack on the server was
successful as well. The reason that the two files are the same is because the server is hosted on the local device so obviously the
passwd file read by selfcomp and the attack on the server are the same.
